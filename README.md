# Hello

## I host my own projects on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/esrh). This is because I dislike github's commercialization as well as microsoft in general. I use this account only to contribute to other projects.

To find out more about me or what I do, please visit my [website](http://esrh.sdf.org)
